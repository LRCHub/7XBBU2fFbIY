high speed progress
step by step into a trap
moment insignificant
no way to penetrate the spotlight surface
so stay outside close to your private light
short-term memory
permanently generating
plastic destiny
trying so hard to turn aside
all the stress from oneself
intelligence frustrates
the polished face
a fading race
fed with facts
to regenerate the lost inborn abilities
we keep on training
that difficult breathing
a forced, perfect state
protects us from rain

easiest moving towards
some difficulties fearless
changing skins renew
to the beginning again and again
a generation exists just one day

short story
mirrors break
asleep in a crack
man-made aid
to alleviate
a man-made pain
